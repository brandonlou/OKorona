After researching between possible databases to consider for the project, we have decided on using MongoDB to support data storage 
and organization for our project. Initially, we were deciding between MySQL and MongoDB, but performance-wise MongoDB is faster. This is
especially the case for larger sets of data. MySQL would be ideal for a secure database, but for the purpose of our project this isn't
a necessity. Currently, there is no code for the database, but we plan to draw a flowchart depicting the flow of information between 
components of our project. After this is done, we plan to insert our datasets about map locations into the database as well as connect
the database to the front-end and other parts of the project. The database would have to handle queries from the front-end, so we are 
planning to add code to handle that later on.
